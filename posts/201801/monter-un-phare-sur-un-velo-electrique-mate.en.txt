    A little bit on the spur of the moment, I took part in a crowd
    funding for an electric folding bike MATE. The funding was a success as
    they raised over $6 million, more than 40 times the minimum amount
    required to launch the project.

I finally got this bike last month. My impressions are mixed and I'll tell you
a bit about it afterwards, but in the meantime, wanting to use it to take the
bus in the morning when it's still dark, I had to find a lighting solution.

Connector 
===========

.. thumbnail:: /images/higo.jpg
   :align: center

There is a black and red connector on the front of
the MATE that delivers 37 V when the control module is in *lighting* mode (after
pressing the top button for a few seconds when the display backlight is on).
It is clearly designed to power a headlight.

I had some troubles finding the reference of this connector. It is in fact
a *Higo mini B* that I was able to order on this `website
<https://www.e-bike-technologies.de/index.php/en/connectors/higo/higo-mini-b-connectors>`_
(or `archive
<https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.e-bike-technologies.de/index.php/en/connectors/higo/higo-mini-b-connector>`_).
Shipping costs are a bit expensive if you order nothing else, but I couldn't find
better.


Light
========

    :align: center

I ordered this `lighting kit
<https://ozo-electric.com/fr/eclairages-haute-puissance-pour-velos/736-kit-eclairage-avantfeu-arriere-ozo-200-lumens20-lumens>`_
which seemed to me to meet my expectations ( powerful front headlight, rear
headlight, possible to fix it on the bike and connectible to the *Higo mini*
connector).


Assembly and result
===================


.. class:: ad

    The assembly was easy enough. The connector is sold mounted on a cable
    about 60 cm long. I mounted the lamp on the connector with tin soldering
    of the two previously stripped cables, all covered by a heat-shrinkable
    sheath, and a little chatterton tape. 

The cable from the front headlight to the rear headlight is a little short to allow
the rear light to be positioned  at the top of the saddle — which is
necessary to ensure proper folding of the bike. Care should be taken when
folding the saddle.

Here's what it looks like:

Impressions on the MATE bike
============================

.. class:: ad

   The delivery is made in a large, TV-like package. The package is in
   good condition. The bike assembly is carried out without too much hassle, except
   for a pedal whose screw pitch is damaged. It took me some time to reform
   the screw pitch of the pedal arm by mounting the pedal inside out before
   reassembling it upright.

Positive points
----------------

This bike is pretty nice. It is easy to use and gives a good help for the
climbs. All in all, he does what was expected.

It is fairly cheap (or at least it was at the time of the start of
crowd funding).

The quality of manufacture is reasonable, without being dazzling.


Negative points or disappointments
------------------------------------

Here are some less satisfactory points:

- The bike is advertised as a *Copenhagen* bike, but of course it is made in China.
- Be careful to remove the battery key before folding the bike. The cables
  that pass by the key can bend it. It happened to me once and I had a
  hard time extracting it. Might as well say the key was unusable after that.
- The development at the greatest speed does not make it possible to exceed
  30 km/h without getting nowhere fast. That's a shame. A somewhat
  larger development would have been welcomed.
- The locking system of the folding does not seem very robust. It has already
  jammed once, and I twisted the locking lever a little bit while trying to
  loosen it. A small turn of screw solved the problem, but you must remain
  vigilant when locking.

Conclusion
==========

I will start using it on  a regular basis starting on Monday. Soon I will know
a little more about the durability and real autonomy of this bike and if the
headlight is bright enough for a night usage.

After a few months of use, I am disappointed by the quality of the bike. The
brakes do not work very well, the battery has a short life, the
new battery sent under warranty was not properly adjusted and
after two openings of the bike the battery cap is broken. 
Avoid it!
