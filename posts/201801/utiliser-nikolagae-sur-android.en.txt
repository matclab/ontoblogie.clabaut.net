.. description: How to use Nikola to write your blog and deploy it on GAE from an Android phone
.. type: text


.. class:: ad

    Some time ago I discovered `Termux <https://termux.com>`_ this cool
    Android app that allows you to find a good part of your linux environment
    on your phone or tablet. 

It has helped me more than once to make a quick change on the move, save it
under git or mercurial before pushing it towards continuous integration. Since
I've `migrated this blog under Nikola
<link://slug/migrating-blog-to-nikola-+-gae>`_ I was thinking it would be convenient to be
able to work on blog posts on the move, to preview them in a browser and to deploy
the whole blog on GAE, everything from a phone.

It actually works pretty well.

Here are the steps to follow:

.. TEASER_END
    
Install Termux
=================

This is simply done from the Google Play app store or better from the `f-droid <https://f-droid.org/repository/browse?fdid=com.termux>`_ repository.


Install mercurial (optional)
============================
`Mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`_ allows me to manage the history
of my blog editing and to push it into a `bitbucket
<https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`_ private repository. I like mercurial as
revision system management tool mainly because of its consistent and well documented interface. Of course you can also use git.

.. code:: shell

   pkg install python2-dev python-dev
   pip2 install mercurial


Install Nikola
================

Preparing a virtual environment
----------------------------------

.. code:: shell

   pip install virtualenvwrapper
   mkvirtualenv nikola

Install Nikola itself
--------------------------------

.. code:: shell

   workon nikola # if you are not already in the virtualenv
   pkg install libxml2-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev libxslt-dev
   LDFLAGS="-L/system/lib/" CFLAGS="-I/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/include/" pip install "Nikola[extras]"


Install the google cloud sdk
-----------------------------

I took my inspiration from the notes by `geoffrey looker <https://github.com/geoffreylooker/termux>`_:


.. code:: shell

   export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python2.7
   curl -k https://storage.googleapis.com/gceprd-iso/google-cloud-sdk-134.0.0-linux-x86_64__TERMUX.tar.gz -O
   tar -xzf google-cloud-sdk-134.0.0-linux-x86_64__TERMUX.tar.gz
   cd google-cloud-sdk
   bash ./install.sh
   bash a #(or zsh depending upon your taste)
   gcloud components update
   ~/update-gcloud-sheebang.sh
   gcloud auth login


Where the script :code:`update-gcloud-sheebang` updates the `shebang
<https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebanghttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang>`_
of each file potentially updated by the command :code:`gcloud components
update` and contains the following few lines:


.. code:: shell

   #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
   scratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)
   cd ~/google-cloud-sdk/
   find $(pwd) -type f -exec awk '
     /^#!.*/{print FILENAME}
     {nextfile}' {} + > "$scratch"/lines.txt
   xargs -0 -n 1 termux-fix-shebang < <(tr \\n \\0 < "$scratch"/lines.txt)



Writing and publishing
======================
Restart a shell and then:

.. code:: shell

   workon nikola
   nikola auto

Then visualize your site in an android browser by visiting http://localhost:8000.

     :width: 200px
     :align: center
     :target: /images/screenshot-firefox-android.png

And finally deploy it on Google App Engine with the command :code:`nikola deploy`.


What remains to be improved
============================

- I have some error messages like ``[2018-01-19T21:28:28Z] WARNING: Nikola:
  Local fr_FR. utf8 for language fr not accepted by local python`` and
  apparently the locales are not well supported by termux. I'm not quite sure
  of the consequences.
- During my first tests, I realized that some utf8 characters were not well
  rendered under ``vim``. I may have a configuration to complete.
- The ``jpegoptim`` software is not available on *termux*, I had to disable it
  in the *nikola* filter configuration which allows the optimization of *jpeg*
  files for the web.

I will update this post to reflect any improvements or other problems I have encountered.
