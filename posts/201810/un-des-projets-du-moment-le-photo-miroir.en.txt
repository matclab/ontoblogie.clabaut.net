    Axel, a long-time friend, changed his professional orientation a few years
    ago to launch "`La Scène <https://www.lascene-aix.com/>`_" in
    Aix-en-Provence. It is a family friendly place where you can spend a
    moment after work during the week, over a drink and some tapas. There are
    concerts, theatrical improvisations and much more, as La Scène is intended
    to be a place for artistic events and much more.

.. TEASER_END

Background
==========

With one of his acquaintances who happened to be a photographer, Axel has
integrated a photographic mirror, *low-tech* descendant of the "photo booths"
that you have certainly used during a wedding or another festive event.

    The main idea is to allow people to take pictures of themselves in the
    evening, but in the eclectic, retro-grandmother and resolutely *low-tech*
    style from La Scène. Thus  a solution without a electronic display,
    without diodes, without lights and without coloured plastics has been
    designed.  The integration carried out at La Scène is particularly
    successful. The camera is setup behind a large mirror in a frame with
    golden mouldings, the tain of which has been removed in the middle in
    order to allow the camera to see through it.

The camera is a Nikon 3100, equipped with an 18-55mm lens and an
external flash.

A button at the end of a cable allows customers to trigger the
camera. the whole things produces this kind of professional quality photo:

However, a number of additionnal features were expected for such an environment:    

- allow to retrieve the photos in order to project them on a giant screen
  in the main room (web slideshow provided),
- allow customers to view the photos on their smartphone,
- upload the photos to flickr or to an FTP site to make them 
  available to the public the day after,
- add a text and/or graphic watermark to each photo.

     is the flash.

Upon Axel's request, I developed a small box based on a *Raspberry Pi* that
connects to the camera via an USB cable and to the local wifi in order to provide
these features.  If you want to get a more precise idea, the `user
documentation is visible here </pages/photomiroir/userguide/en/>`_.


Technical Side
===============

The chosen *Raspberry Pi* is a 3B+ model which has the particularity of having
an integrated wifi. The wifi is configured to access the LAN and to provide a
a captive portal allowing customers to access photos from their own
smartphone. The OS is  *Arch linux*, configured to use the repository
`http://tardis.tiny-vps.com/aarm/ <http://tardis.tiny-vps.com/aarm/>`_ in
order to be able to obtain a known and tested configuration.

The software (photo manager and web interface) is written in python 3.7.

The other software used are:

- *gphoto2* (and its python binding) to retrieve the photos,
- *dnsmasq* + *hostapd* + *iptables* + *ngninx* for the captive portal,
- *sphinx* for documentation. *Robotframework* coupled with
  *selenium* are used to automatically extract screenshots from the
  configuration web application,
- `sigal <http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/>`_ to generate the photo gallery,
- *py.test* for testing,
- *bottle* for the web server of the configuration and administration applicatio,
- `diaporama <https://github.com/gre/diaporama>`_ as a javascript library
  for the animation of the slideshow (images are sent on demand from
  the server via websockets)
- *grafana*, *prometheus* and *prometheus push gateway* for monitoring,
- *tor* to provide ssh access for maintenance and troubleshooting (at least on the
  test version of La Scène),

Photos
======

Here after is a random sample of the photos taken at La Scène:

.. raw:: html

    <style type="text/css"> 
    .flickr_badge_image {margin:0px;display:inline;}
    .flickr_badge_image img {border: 1px solid #666666 !important; padding:1px; margin:2px;}
    #flickr_badge_wrapper {width:420px;text-align:left}
    </style>
    <center><div id="flickr_badge_wrapper"></center>
    <script type="text/javascript"
    src="https://www.flickr.com/badge_code_v2.gne?count=10&display=random&size=s&layout=x&source=user&user=155012756@N06"></script>

They are all visible on the `Flickr space of La Scène
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/la_scene/albums>`_.

And then what?
==============

A number of improvements or new features are
planned. I also consider switching the software licence to open-source in order to
to benefit other people. 

To be continued...
