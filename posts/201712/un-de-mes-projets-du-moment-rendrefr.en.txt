   It's been a few months since one of my personal projects get online.
   Namely, https://bback.me, a service to help you find your lost items with the help of
   *people*!

This service is based on the observation that most people are willing to
return a found object to its owner, if only they would be able to contact 
him. 
Thus, the number of posts on social networks about people having found lost
items and seeking for their owner.

.. TEASER_END

How it works
==============

   The main idea — which in itself is not new — is to mark objects with an
   identifier that allows the person who finds the object to contact its
   owner. The novelty is to mark objects with a short internet addresses (URL),
   recognizable as such.

The main characteristics are as follows:

- The service is free of charge and relies on user donations to balance operating costs.

- Each person can choose the domain name that they think is most likely to be
  recognized or understood by the person who finds the object.

  For example, in France, we may use ``cqi.fr`` or ``rendre.fr``. In
  Anglo-Saxon countries, ``bback.org`` and  ``bback.me`` will be more suitable.
  For the Dutch, ``kwijt.nu`` will be more appropriate. More generally, the
  domains ``hooz.it`` and ``lost.re`` are also available.

We do not supply labels because it is difficult to provide formats suitable for different uses. You can use any means at your disposal to mark your objects.

On a personal level, I frequently use labels produced with the help of a `label printer <https://rendre.fr/manage_/faq#how-to-mark-my-objects>`_ (€20 on line), or  textile labels `buyed online <https://rendre.fr/manage_/faq#you-sell labels>`_.

Organization

    I set up as an "auto-entrepreneur" in order to legally host my personal projects
    that could generate costs and financial income. My "stage" name is
    *Antipodae*. I will have other projects to present to you in the coming months.

I had some concern about the cost of being an "auto-entrepreneur",
especially the CFE (cotisation foncière des entreprises), but it is possible
to avoid this tax if you don't have any financial income.


Technique
==========

.. class:: ad

   On the technical side, the site is developed in Python with the `framework
   Web2py <web2py. org>`_. It is hosted by *Google App Engine*. 

The *web2py* framework allows, taking into account the constraints of the GAE
NoSQL database, to develop an application that can be hosted on GAE, but also
be migrated under a more traditional environment if necessary. This solution
was chosen so as not to be locked in the GAE ecosystem if it no longer met
the need.

The tests are developed with the help of `Pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ and
`Splinter <https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ which in turn relies
on `Selenium <http://www.seleniumhq.org/>`_ to perform UI tests. Continuous
integration is managed by an instance of `Jenkins <https://jenkins-ci.org/>`_.

The payment service is provided by `Stripe <https://stripe.com>`_. Integration
tests use `Vcrpy <https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to replay queries
and answers from *Stripe* to save time and allow for offline tests replay.

Sending mail is an important component of the service and is therefore
duplicated between an internally managed `Exim <https://exim.org>`_ server,
the `Sendgrid <https://sendgrid.com>`_ service and the mail sending service
included with the GAE service as a last resort.



Website
========

The service is composed of several identical sites, with the same name
(rendre.fr, bback.org, kwijt.nu,...). All images of the site are generated
from a source image in SVG format, then translated according to the language
and site of destination, with the help of the translation tools provided by the
web2py framework. For example for the home page strip:

.. figure:: /images/strip-rendre.fr.png
   :alt: French image for the site rendre.fr
   :class: "thumbnail img-responsive"
   :target: /images/strip-rendre.fr.png

   Image in english for the site rendre.fr

.. figure:: /images/strip-bback.me.png
   :alt: image in English for the site bback.me
   :class: "thumbnail img-responsive"
   :target: /images/strip-bback.me.png

   Image in English for the site bback.me


In the following example, note that the name of the object entered by the user
on his screen is translated.

     :class: "thumbnail img-responsive"
     :target: /images/frregister.png

     :class: "thumbnail img-responsive"
     :target: /images/enregister.png

The frame of the site is built on a home made template `booststrap <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_.

Conclusion
==========

I hope this site will be of some help. Feel free to use it and to give feedback.
