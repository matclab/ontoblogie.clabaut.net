     The last straw!

    We know it, we repeat it: "Plastic is a plague for the 
    planet!" Straws are an example of a disposable manufactured product that 
    has invaded our society. You probably know that if you have children 
    who for the most part love to use straws.

You will find many videos illustrating the pollution caused by 
straws, and this one is quite well made, because it also tells the story 
of straws. How did we end up making plastic straws?

   By a strange dissociation of meaning, the word straw has over time 
   acquired a new meaning. Initially referring to a grass stem 
   stripped of its grain, it has also become the tube used to 
   to sip a drink.

The dissociation of the two senses is such that my children have had a kind of 
epiphany when realizing that the straws were called "straw" because we 
used straws as straw in the past (is that clear?).

   In short, with this in mind, we went to explore our environment 
   to see what we could find for replacing the plastic straws. At the foot of the vineyards 
   in the neighborood, we find this:

     Straws on the loose.

Once picked, delicately cut at the ends with a pruning shear 
and stripped of their brown outer envelopes, it gives you that kind of 
harvest:

   In daily use, the "grassy taste" mentioned in the video is not noticeable 
   (at least for cold liquids), and these natural and reusable straws 
   have replaced plastic one at home. After use, 
   we rinse them and let them dry. They are composted when they 
   are broken or too damaged for suction to be effective.
