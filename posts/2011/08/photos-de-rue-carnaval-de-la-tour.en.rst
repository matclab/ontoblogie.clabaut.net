I finally decided to publish some of my photos.

As I need to sort a lot of them,  I started with those already online
and which, being taken while a public event, are
publishable without asking too many questions …

These photos are published under the  `cc-by-sa <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__  license,
which allows them to be reused provided they are attributed to myself
and that any redistribution being done under the same
licence. I emphazise this because I had the great pleasure to find these
photos in the municipality newspaper, unfortunately without any
reference to the source of the photos…
