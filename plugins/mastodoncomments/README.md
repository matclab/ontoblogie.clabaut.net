Use [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) as a comment system for static site generator [Nikola](https://getnikola.com).

Mastodon is a federated microblogging network, based on the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol.
Users can respond to anchor posts in the Fediverse.

# How to configure
The settings for Mastodon Comments can be passed to the plugin as follows:

```python
COMMENT_SYSTEM = "mastodoncomments"
COMMENT_SYSTEM_ID = 'nerdculture.de'
GLOBAL_CONTEXT = {
    ...
    "mastodon_config": {
        'account_id': '109270094542366763',
        'account': 'fluchtkapsel'
    }
}
```
The COMMENT_SYSTEM_ID contains the schemeless URL of the Mastodon instance you wish to use for your comments. See [this page](https://khendrikse.netlify.app/blog/find-your-mastodon-account-id/) on how to find your Mastodon account id.

# How to install
You need to copy the folder `$BLOG_ROOT/plugins/mastodoncomments/files/assets` to `$BLOG_ROOT/files/assets`
```
cp -a plugins/mastodoncomments/files/assets files/
```

Additionally, it requires DOMpurify in your `files/assets/js` folder which you can install by
```
cd files/assets/js && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cure53/DOMPurify/main/dist/purify.min.js
```

# How to use
This plugin fetches Mastodon posts which are in reply to a post that is referred to in a Nikola page's or post's meta data. Ideally, you write a blog entry, link to that blog entry on Mastodon and grab this Mastodon post's ID. Put this ID in the post's or page's meta data:
```
.. mastodon: 12345678901234567890
```
