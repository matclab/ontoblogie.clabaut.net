message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found a sea shell and \r\ngave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never \r\nwants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!\r\nBillige Fodboldtr√∏jer"
